Description: Using a unique taxon name (mapped to genbank with rentrez), you can download all the genbank sequences from that taxon (using phylotaR), cluster by gene (phylotaR), align (using mafft), throw out clusters that don't have enough sequences, delete gappy columns, make partition files, and make a tree (using raxml).
